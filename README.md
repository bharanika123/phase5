This script will read the market basket data, perform the analysis, and generate
visualizations and insights.
Configuration:
 input_file: Specify the name of your market basket data file (default:
market_basket_data.csv).
 delimiter: Specify the delimiter used in your data file (default: ,).
 Other configuration options can be added as needed based on your specific use case.
Output: The script will generate visualizations such as bar charts, heatmaps, and
association rules, providing insights into product relationships and customer behavior.
The results will be saved in the output directory within the project folder.
Example Output:
 association_rules.csv: CSV file containing association rules generated from the
market basket analysis.
 bar_chart.png: Bar chart visualizing product frequency.
 heatmap.png: Heatmap showing the correlation between different products.
 Additional output files may be generated based on the specific analysis performed.

Association Analysis
# Perform market basket analysis using Apriori algorithm
frequent_itemsets = apriori(data_encoded, min_support=0.1, use_colnames=True)

# Generate association rules
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric=&quot;confidence&quot;, min_threshold=0.7)

# Print the association rules
print(rules)
In this example:
 data.csv is your raw data file containing transactional data, where each row represents
a transaction, and columns represent items bought in that transaction.
 min_support is the minimum support threshold for itemsets to be considered frequent.
Adjust this based on your dataset.
